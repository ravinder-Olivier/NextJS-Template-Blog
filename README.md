This is how your blog posts will be written, the top meta info will not be shown in the user page, that is just the greymatter for the system to work properly. More info at [Github.com/jonschlinkert/gray-matter](https://github.com/jonschlinkert/gray-matter)

## Customizing

You can edit the favicon in /public/images, or you can change the header and footer in /components/layout.js.
